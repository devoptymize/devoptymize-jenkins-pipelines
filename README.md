## Jenkins script for creating the RDS cluster
### Overview
- This is a Jenkins script that create an RDS cluster in AWS account.

- The pipeline includes the following steps:

- First, it takes user input in the form of credentials to provision the resources on AWS account. The pipeline uses the ChoiceParameter to provide a list of credentials to choose from. The GroovyScript block defines the logic to fetch the credentials available in the Jenkins instance and returns a list of credentials associated with the user's login.

- The pipeline then create the RDS cluster. It extracts the environment name from the input parameter and uses it to generate the names of the resources. With the Credentials block reads the access key and secret key from the AWS credentials associated with the account and uses them to run the CFT and TF commands that create the RDS database.

- The agent any directive specifies that the pipeline can run on any agent machine with a specific label or without a label. In this case, it is not restricted to any agent machine.

- The environment block defines two environment variables that are derived from the user input. PROJECT_NAME is extracted from the credential name, and ACCOUNT_ID is extracted by splitting the credential name at the underscore (_) character.

- The pipeline has three stages:

  - The first stage cleans the workspace by removing any existing files from it. If the environment name parameter is empty, the pipeline stops and displays an error message. Otherwise, it sets the display name for the current build to include the project name, AWS account ID, and environment name.
  - The second stage used for SCM Checkout which instructs jenkins to obtain pipeline from SCM.
  - The third stage is to create the RDS cluster in the defined region. It uses the if and else block to set the environment variables required for CloudFormationTemplate and Terraform. For CFT, The process will wait, it outputs a message indicating that the stack creation is still in progress and waits for 30 seconds before checking the status again, after the stack creation complete. It will commit the output file in ops_devoptimize repo. It then runs the CFT and TF commands to create the RDS cluster.

- Overall, this script provides a way to automate the creation of resources required for Terraform state management,CloudFormation and resource locking in an AWS account.

#### Limitations

- The create and delete actions were functioning correctly in the Terraform script, except for the modify action.
- The modify action should work as intended in the Terraform script, similar to how create and delete actions are functioning correctly.

### DevOptymize_Jenkins_Pipelines
A DevOptymize_Jenkins_Pipelines Git repository refers to a source code repository that contains the definition of a Jenkins pipeline.


#### Features:
- Creating AWS network resources using IaC (Terraform/CloudFormation) templates with parameterized jenkins build.
- Can be used to Create and Delete network resources incase of Cloudformation and can Create, Modify and Delete network resources incase of Terraform.
- Can be used to define environment in which resource can be created.
